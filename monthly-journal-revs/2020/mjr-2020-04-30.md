- Debate about **"correct" modelling of kinship** (incest taboo, clan form of social organisation):
    - Original publication: Itao & Kaneko (2020) Evolution of kinship structures driven by marriage tie and competition. PNAS 117(5):2378–2384 https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1917716117
    - Read & Parkin (2020) Simulation model for kinship structures is ethnographically invalid. PNAS 117(17):9166 https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2002389117. "What the authors call the incest taboo is actually a cultural marriage rule prohibiting within-group marriages. [...] The authors mistakenly assume a clan is a cluster of interacting lineages."
    - Itao & Kaneko (2020) Reply to Read and Parkin: Our model correctly expresses the ethnographic nature of the cultural incest taboo and kinship structures. PNAS 117(17):9167–9168 https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2003300117. "The incest taboo has both cultural (symbolic) and biological implications. [...] we are interested in the former — 'a cultural marriage rule prohibiting within-group marriages' [...] the clan corresponds to 'lineages that recognize the same apical ancestor from whom lineage members believe they are descended' [...]. Here, the difference between the clans of parents and children is a matter of marriage possibility, not the living site [...]."
