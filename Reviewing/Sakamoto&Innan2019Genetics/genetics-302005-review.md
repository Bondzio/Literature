### Model

- [l. 29] The introduction to Eq. (3) seems too compact. I suggest saying something along the lines of "After substitution of Equation 2 into Equation 1, one can show that solutions to Equation 1 can be obtained by solving the following system of equations:". Along the same lines, it would therefore appear that there are solutions to Equation 1 that are not found by solving Equation 3. The non-existence of further solutions would need to be proved, but this does not seem necessary here.
