Dear ******** ********,

Thank you for submitting your manuscript to PLOS ONE. After careful consideration, we feel that it has merit, but is not suitable for publication as it currently stands. Therefore, my decision is "Major Revision." 

We invite you to submit a revised version of the manuscript that addresses the points below: 

* adding an additional external reference for the Americas is sine qua non to demonstrate selection effects that are rainforest-specific rather than Pima-specific. 

We encourage you to submit your revision within forty-five days of the date of this decision. 

When your files are ready, please submit your revision by logging on to http://pone.edmgr.com/ and following the Submissions Needing Revision link. Do not submit a revised manuscript as a new submission. Before uploading, you should proofread your manuscript very closely for mistakes and grammatical errors. Should your manuscript be accepted for publication, you may not have another chance to make corrections as we do not offer pre-publication proofs.

If you would like to make changes to your financial disclosure, please include your updated statement in your cover letter. 

In addition, when submitting your revision please include the following items: 
	•	
	•	A rebuttal letter that responds to each point brought up by the academic editor and reviewer(s). This letter should be uploaded as a 'Response to Reviewers' file.
	•	
	•	A clean revised manuscript as your 'Manuscript' file.
	•	
	•	A marked-up copy of the changes made from the previous article file as a 'Revised Manuscript with Track Changes' file. This can be done using 'track changes' in programs such as MS Word and/or highlighting any changes in the new document.
	•	

For more information on how to upload your revised submission, see our video: http://blogs.plos.org/everyone/2011/05/10/how-to-submit-your-revised-manuscript/

If you choose not to submit a revision, please notify us. 

Yours sincerely, 

Francesc Calafell

* p. 2 and p. 3:"It is unclear if human beings" -> "It is unclear whether human beings"
* p. 2: "studies on pygmy phenotype" ->"studies on the pygmy phenotype"
* p. 3: "the reproductive parts that are the most edible parts for humans and their preys" -> "the reproductive organs that are the most edible parts for humans and their prey species"

* p. 4: "For doing so" -> "To that effect"
* P. 6: It should also be noted that balancing selection produces low Fst values if the selection coefficients are the same across populations. In tropical rainforest environments of different continents they may well not be.
* P. 8: "which was overcome by the sample" -> "which is clearly smaller than the sample".
* P. 11: "for each outlier SNPs" -> "for each outlier SNP"
* P. 17: "14 significant pathways remain significant" -> "14 pathways remain significant"

Please use the space provided to explain your answers to the questions above. You may also include additional comments for the author, including concerns about dual publication, research ethics, or publication ethics. (Please upload your review as an attachment if it exceeds 20,000 characters)

Reviewer #2: (No Response)

Reviewer #1: I understand the issues raised by the authors about the time required to redo the analyses and the smaller number of SNPs within the Reich et al, 2012 populations. However, I do not think using just one American non-tropical population is correct. Based on the same rationale for which a West African non-tropical cluster was created; there should be an American non-tropical cluster. I do not expect the lower number of SNPs reported by Reich et al. to be an issue, so I will suggest performing some analyses by replacing the Pima by several of the Reich et al non-tropical populations to make sure that the reported signals hold.



7. If you would like your identity to be revealed to the authors, please include your name here (optional).

Your name and review will not be published with the manuscript.
