Summary
=======

A combination of three concerns lead to my recommendation for a rejection: 1) Neither the extent of methodological innovation nor the biological insight gained from an application to A. gambiae seem to keep up with what I would consider appropriate for publication in PLoS Genetics; 2) There is a lack of understanding of the mechanistics behind of some of the results, and a potential confusion of the signatures of selection and demography; 3) The manuscript needs substantial editorial revision; it has redndant parts and the writing is often overly wordy.

- The approach proposed here is a compilation of methods to a single pipeline of analysis to detect the signature of selection. There is appeal to this undertaking and the rationale behind the different steps is plausible. However, the methods put together have individually been used in the literature before: inference of demographic history using site-frequency spectra; Fst-outlier tests to identify loci under selection; discriminant function analysis of PC-transformed summary statistics. My feeling is that the degree of innovation is therefore limited and might not quite keep up with what I would expect from a PLoS Genetics article.

- The central idea of this paper is to fit separate neutral null-models to different genomic regions (collinear vs. inversions), and to then identify candidates for targets of selection for regions of interest (inersions). The rationale is that inverted regions may have experienced a different demographic history due to reduced recombination rates. However, I am concerned that if selection was acting in the inverted regions, this will lead to a signature that is hard to separate from demography. In view of selection, inversion might essentially behave as a single super-locus. If this is the case, it is questionable whether identifying individual candidate sites is meaningful; many of the detected sites are likely not causal. I think the way forward would be to develop a more principle-based model that accounts for the effect of linked selection and demography jointly.

- Related to the previous issue, the step where the recombination rates are adjusted in bins along the inverted regions was dubious to me. Although I understand the rationale, I am nervous that this not only corrects for "demography", but also to some extent for the long-range effect of linked selection. If this is the case, I wonder about the consequences for the step that actually tries to detect selection. I realise that it is difficult to independently estimate recombination rates in inversions that are potentially affected by selection. However, I think this issue should at least be discussed.

- If I understood correctly, only the DAPC part for inference of selection was tested in a simulation study. Although it is very important to know that this part seems to 'work', there is a lack of understanding of what creates the differences in performance between the Fst-outlier approach and DAPC (see next point). More fundamentally for this paper, however, I think that the performance (in terms of false discovery rate, false positive rate, and detection power) of the *entire* pipeline should be assessed, not only of the DAPC part.

- I missed an explanation for why the "DAPC-region" method had a much better detection power than the Fst-outlier approach. Is it because of the nature of DAPC per se? Or because Fst-outlier tests per definition are using Fst, whereas you allow the DAPC to also use pi (heterozygosity)? How would DAPC perform if you allowed it to use Fst only? On the other hand, would a pi-outlier scan perform better than an Fst-outlier scan? Similarly, why did the DAPC-region method outperform the DAPC-locus method in terms of detection power? It is very interesting that the DAPC-region method had higher detection power at the same time as having lower false discovery rate. I was missing an explanation for this, though.

- The test of performance for the detection of selection was only done with a single locus under selection. Given that the applications to real data detect multiple potential targets of selection, I think the method should also be tested against simulations with multiple selected sites. This might not be possible using msms, but it seems crucial to me, given that low recombination rates have a strong impact on the interplay of multiple loci under weak selection, and hence their joint signature on diversity.

- While the application to A. gambiae as a vector of malaria bears some biological relevance, I nevertheless think that to justify publication in PLoS Genetics, the identified candidate sites would have to be further studied. There would need to be at least an analysis of enrichment for functional terms. I also find it hard to believe that so many sites (regions) on 2La are individually under selection (Fig. 3). If this is an artefact of strong "linked" selection (many candidates may not be actual causal sites), it is questionable whether it is a good idea to look for individual outliers, rather than modelling an aggregate effect of linked selection for a given genomic region.
