Summary
=======

In this manuscript, the authors propose a procedure to detect the signature of selection in genomic regions that potentially have a different demographic history compared to the rest of the genome. The genomic regions of interest here are inversions. After inferring region-specific demographic histories, from which they obtain region-specific neutral null models, the authors train a discriminant function based on simulated data. Simulations are done both under the neutral null models, and under specific scenarios of selection. The discriminant function is trained on the principal components of a set of summary statistics. Its task is to distinguish between the neutral vs. selection models, but not to infer parameter values. To account for the variation in effective recombination rate between the inversion breakpoints, the authors use an ad-hoc method to break down the region-wide estimates of gene flow to smaller physical units. The approach is designed to cope with elevated background divergence in regions of low recombination, which makes it challenging to detect candidates of selection based on patterns of increased divergence. Two variants of the approach are presented.
The authors conduct a simulation study with a single locus under selection to compare the performance of their approach to a classical Fst-outlier scan in terms of false positive and false discovery rate, and in terms of detection power. The approach based on discriminant functions performs best, but only if the signature from mulitple neutral SNPs in the neighbourhood of the site under selection is integrated. If only one neutral SNP is probed, the performance is more similar to the Fst-outlier approach.
The novel approach is then applied to RADseq data from the Anopheles gambiae/arabiensis species complex. Two inversions on chromosome 2 are compared to the rest of the genome. For each inversion, the standard (S) and inverted (I) arrangements have been associated with wet and dry habitats in previous studies. Moroever, previous work seems to suggest that the I arrangements have introgressed from A. arab. into A. gam. The authors infer that one of the inversions is older than the split of the two species, and that selection has acted on the standard, rather than on the introgressing inverted arrangement. Conclusions about these inversions being involved in adaptation to both wet and dry conditions are made, although evidence for this seems far from compelling to me.

While the manuscript presents an interesting idea and tackles a very important issue, a combination of three concerns lead to my recommendation for a rejection: 1) Neither the extent of methodological innovation nor the biological insight gained from an application to A. gambiae seem to keep up with what I would consider appropriate for publication in PLoS Genetics; 2) There is a lack of understanding of the statistical and biological mechanistics behind some of the results, and a potential confusion of the signatures of selection and demography; 3) The manuscript needs substantial editorial revision; it contains redundant parts and the writing is often overly wordy or grammatically incorrect.


General comments
================

- The approach proposed here is a compilation of methods to a single pipeline of analysis to detect the signature of selection. There is appeal to this undertaking and the rationale behind the different steps is plausible. However, the methods put together have individually been used in the literature before: inference of demographic history using site-frequency spectra; Fst-outlier tests to identify loci under selection; discriminant function analysis of PC-transformed summary statistics. My feeling is that the degree of innovation is therefore limited and might not quite keep up with what I would expect from a PLoS Genetics article.

- The central idea of this paper is to fit separate neutral null-models to different genomic regions (collinear vs. inversions), and to then identify candidates for targets of selection for regions of interest (inversions). The rationale is that inverted regions may have experienced a different demographic history due to reduced recombination rates and/or introgression. However, I am concerned that if selection was acting in the inverted regions, this will lead to a signature that is hard to separate from demography. In view of selection, inversions might essentially behave as a single super-locus. If this is the case, it is questionable whether identifying individual candidate sites is meaningful; many of the detected sites are likely not causal. I think the way forward would be to develop a more principle-based model that accounts for the effect of linked selection and demography jointly.

- Related to the previous issue, the step where the recombination rates are adjusted in bins along the inverted regions was dubious to me. Although I understand the rationale, I am nervous that this not only corrects for "demography", but also to some extent for the long-range effect of linked selection. If this is the case, I wonder about the consequences for the step that actually tries to detect selection. I realise that it is difficult to independently estimate recombination rates in inversions that are potentially affected by selection. However, I think this issue should at least be discussed.

- If I understood correctly, only the DAPC part for inference of selection was tested in a simulation study. Although it is very important to know that this part seems to 'work', there is a lack of understanding of what creates the differences in performance between the Fst-outlier approach and DAPC (see next point). More fundamentally for this paper, however, I think that the performance (in terms of false discovery rate, false positive rate, and detection power) of the *entire* pipeline should be assessed, not only of the DAPC vs. Fst-outlier part.

- I missed an explanation for why the "DAPC-region" method had a much better detection power than the Fst-outlier approach. Is it because of the nature of DAPC per se? Or because Fst-outlier tests per definition are using Fst, whereas you allow the DAPC to also use pi (heterozygosity)? How would DAPC perform if you allowed it to use Fst only? On the other hand, would a pi-outlier scan perform better than an Fst-outlier scan? Similarly, why did the DAPC-region method outperform the DAPC-locus method in terms of detection power? It is very interesting that the DAPC-region method had higher detection power at the same time as having lower false discovery rate. The partial explanation in the Discussion that the DAPC-region method is more robust in the face of noisy data would, if I understood correctly, explain a lower false-positive rate, but not necessarily a higher detection power.

- The test of performance for the detection of selection was only done with a single locus under selection. Given that the applications to real data detect multiple potential targets of selection, I think the method should also be tested against simulations with multiple selected sites. This might not be possible using msms, but it seems crucial to me, given that low recombination rates have a strong impact on the interplay of multiple loci under weak selection, and hence their joint signature on diversity.

- While the application to A. gambiae as a vector of malaria bears some biological relevance, I wonder if, to justify publication in PLoS Genetics, the identified candidate sites would have to be further studied. There would need to be at least an analysis of enrichment for functional terms. I also find it hard to believe that so many sites (regions) on 2La are individually under selection (Fig. 3). If this is an artefact of strong "linked" selection (many candidates may not be actual causal sites), it is questionable whether it is a good idea to look for individual outliers, rather than modelling an aggregate effect of linked selection for a given genomic region.

- The authors seem to find that selection occurred in favour of the 2L+a (S) arrangement rather than the introgressed 2La (I) arrangement. They conclude that this suggests that "the same region" has been involved in two episodes of adaptation, to wet and dry habitats. I could not follow this argument and was not convinced that the results support this conclusion. I found it confusing that the I arrangement is called an "adaptive" introgression from A. arab. into A. gam. although the results presented here suggest that it is actually not adaptive in A. gam., but rather deleterious.

- This study has only looked at scenarios of directional selection, either in favour of the S arrangement, or in favour of the I arrangement. In both cases, the nature of selection is defined only by the status of the inversion. While this seems to be supported by earlier literature showing correlations between dry and wet periods and the frequency of I and S arrangements, repsecitvely, I wonder whether selection could act in the form of underdominance. Selection against heterokaryotypes (S/I genotypes) in A. gam. might lead to elevated divergence between S and I in A. gam. Of course, underdominance would not necessarily lead to a stable situation in the long term, and it might be hard to explain the cyclic behaviour of I and S arrangements with dry and wet conditions.

- Similar to ABC, the DAPC approach relies on summary statistics. It is known that summary statistics are hardly ever sufficient for model comparison (e.g. Robert et al. 2011 PNAS). This issue should be mentioned.

Title
-----

I found the construction "demography-informed selection signatures" unfortunate, as the signature of selection is not really demography-informed itself. The title also promises to reveal two different roles for the two inversions. Having read the paper, I am not clear about what the difference actually is.


Abstract
--------

The abstract is too wordy. See below for some specific comments.

l3: Add "in the face of gene flow" after "loci".

l4-6: That might not hold for very old and/or long inversions, where recombination has enough time to equilibrate diversities, except perhaps very close to the breakpoints.

l6-l9: This sentence is too long and too complicated. Please revise it.

l9: "We demonstrate the approach with an analysis of RAD..." -> "We apply our approach to RAD..."

l13: Insert comma after "inversions".

l13-14: "compared with prevalence of" -> "and". "Despite of both being adaptive..." -> "Although both are adaptive...". As mentioned above, I had a problem with these introgressions being called "adaptive", if it turns out that the introgressing arrangement 2La (I) is selected *against* in A. gam.

l16: A word is missing between "selected" and "within". "predated" -> "predates"

l20: I find the phrase "...exhibits much more selection signatures than..." unfortunate.


Author summary
--------------

l2-3: "With this new approach we found the..." -> "We found that the..."

l4: "...has involved in..." -> "...has been involved in..." (?)

l8: Insert "in inversions" after "...targets of selection".


Introduction
------------

p1.l6-7: This sentence does not make sense to me.

p1.l20-l25: Isn't the first characteristic just a consequence of the second one?

p1.l22-l25: This sentence is too long.

p1.l26-l29: In some sense, this rationale is strange, because the inversion could be considered as a single outlier compared to the rest of the genome, in which case the approaches criticised here might detect them. Of course, it is not straightforward to interprete the fact that a whole inversion pops out as an outlier. Insert closing round bracket after "FLK [13]".

p2.l7-8: "assign" -> "classify"; "into" -> "as"; "selection classes...function" -> "under selection"

p2.l8: "the newly develped" -> "our"

p2.l12: Delete "the"

p2.l14: "defy" -> "complicate"

p2.l15: Delete "across the inversions"

p2.l18: "identify its role in..." -> "suggest that 2La is causally related to...". "..., as do similar trends observed in 2Rb" -> ". Similar trends are observed in 2Rb"

p2.l25: "...high divergence problem..." -> "...problem of high divergence..."

p2.l26: "Nevertheless, despite these challenges, as our analyses demonstrate, we are..." -> "Despite these challenges, we are..."

p2.l29-30: "We highlight...An. gambiae" -> "We discuss implications four our understanding of rapid divergence in the malaria vector An. gambiae"

p2.l31: "for" -> "to". Delete "more generally"

p3.l1: "than" -> "compared to". Delete "because of the mosaic nature".


Results
-------

p1.l8: "Radseq" -> "RADseq" (Applies to other places. I am not going to repeat myself.)

p1.l16: Delete "new"

p1.l17: Insert comma after "First"

p1.l18: "using" -> "from"; "spectrum" -> "spectra"

p1.l19: "inversion specific" -> "inversion-specific"; "gene flux rate" -> "the rate of gene flow"

p1.l20: "...age of inversion mutations" -> "...age of the inversions"

p1.l20-23: This sentence is too long and too complicated.

p1.l26: Delete "analyses"; delete "in the species".

p2.l9: Invert the order of the two numbers (smaller one first) (?).

p2.l10: "...which is about exchanging..." -> "...which corresponds to..."

p2.l9-10: Please check whether the two pairs of numbers (migration rate <> individuals) are consistent. A quick back-of-the-envelope calculation revealed some disagreement, but I did not double-check.

p2.l11-l12: Please remove the information about the physical position of the inversion and place it in the "Material and Methods" section.

p2.l12: "were distributed into one of" -> "formed"

p2.l15-18: Reformulate and shorted, e.g. to: "A comparison with molecular karyotyping results shows that the three clusters correspond to the three inversion genotypes: the inverted homokaryotypes (I/I), the heterokaryotypes (I/S), and the standard (non-inverted) homokaryotypes (S/S) (Fig. S4c, f)."

p2.l21: "gene flux" -> "gene flow" (?) (Applies to other places. I am not going to repeat myself.)

p2.l23-l24: Reformulate to "The inversion in An. gambiae was modeled as being introgressed from An. arabiensis after the split of the two species"

p2.l24: Delete "mutation"

p2.l25-26: "their introgression time" -> "the time of introgression"; "expected for detecting selection" -> "between the two karyotypes"

p2.l23-26: I am concerned about selection having a confounding impact on the inference of demographic parameters. In particular, the estimate of the coalescence time of S and I (T_IS) might have been inflated by divergent selection.

p2.l27: Insert "the" before "species"

p2.l26-30: If this scenario is true, then what maintained the S/I (ancestral) polymorphism during the 2.5 Ne generations in the species ancestral to A. arab. and A. gam.? Directional selection in favour of the S arrangement of 2La (as suggested by this study) might have lead to the extinction of the I arrangement. I therefore wonder if the mode of selection changed over time.

p3.l2: "inversion specific" -> "inversion-specific"

p3.l3: Delete "double"

p3.l4: "versus breaking points" -> "versus close to the breakpoints"

p3.l2-6: This procedure of adjusting local recombination rates seems very much ad hoc in nature. Without an explicit model incorporating both selection and demography, it is difficult to judge if it is appropriate.

p3.l8: Delete "e.g.," and the first "percentile"

p3.l6-12: Please report values of within-arrangement diversity and total diversity (i.e. the ingredients to calculating Fst) separately. Which of the two is responsible for high Fst?

p3.l22-23: Please make sure the statements about selection here and in "Material and Methods" (p5.l5-7) are congruent. As stated before, I wonder if the data could also be explained by a model of selection against hybrids (underdominance) instead of directional selection, or by temporally varying selection (driven, e.g., by alternating dry and wet periods).

p3.l29-30: Delete "which ...or not"

p3.l30: Insert "the" before "three". Why "therefore"?

p4.l1: "...with a comparable false-positive rates (~0.06) as the..." -> "...with false-positive rates (~0.06) comparable to the..."

p4.l4-5: This seems important, and I would like to see a visualisation of the information contained in the various summary statistics (see previous comments related to this).

p4.l5: "of the variance" -> "to the variance"

Discussion
----------



px.lx: The list of references shold be comlemented by recent theoretical work on the interplay of gene flow, recombination and selection (e.g. Bürger and coauthors).
