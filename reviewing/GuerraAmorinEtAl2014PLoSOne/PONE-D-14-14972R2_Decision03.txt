Dear ******** ********,

Thank you for submitting your manuscript for review to PLOS ONE. After careful consideration, we feel that your manuscript will likely be suitable for publication if it is revised to address the points below. Therefore, my decision is "Minor Revision."

We invite you to submit a revised version of the manuscript that includes the English edits listed below, which may be sufficient to produce an acceptable manuscript.

We encourage you to submit your revision within forty-five days of the date of this decision. 

When your files are ready, please submit your revision by logging on to http://pone.edmgr.com/ and following the Submissions Needing Revision link. Do not submit a revised manuscript as a new submission. Before uploading, you should proofread your manuscript very closely for mistakes and grammatical errors. Should your manuscript be accepted for publication, you may not have another chance to make corrections as we do not offer pre-publication proofs.

If you would like to make changes to your financial disclosure, please include your updated statement in your cover letter. 

In addition, when submitting your revision please include the following items: 
	•	
	•	A rebuttal letter that responds to each point brought up by the academic editor and reviewer(s). This letter should be uploaded as a 'Response to Reviewers' file.
	•	
	•	A clean revised manuscript as your 'Manuscript' file.
	•	
	•	A marked-up copy of the changes made from the previous article file as a 'Revised Manuscript with Track Changes' file. This can be done using 'track changes' in programs such as MS Word and/or highlighting any changes in the new document.
	•	

For more information on how to upload your revised submission, see our video: http://blogs.plos.org/everyone/2011/05/10/how-to-submit-your-revised-manuscript/

If you choose not to submit a revision, please notify us.

Yours sincerely,
