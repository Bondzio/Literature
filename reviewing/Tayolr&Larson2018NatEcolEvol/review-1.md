# Summary

Taylor and Larson present a concise and well-written review on recent developments in the study of hybridisation in the era of genomics. The authors focus on the prevalence of ancient hybridisation, the challenges of demonstrating an adaptive nature of introgression, and the on-going debate about the importance of hybridisation as a direct mechanism of speciation. These are long-standing questions in evolutionary biology that are now becoming more accessible with the availability of high-resolution genome sequences from a growing range of taxa. The review is therefore timely. The authors nicely place these questions into the historical context, summarise recent achievements, and discuss the challenges that remain to be addressed. Overall, I have no doubt that this review will be informative and relevant to a broad readership. I only had a few comments that might help towards diversifying the cited research and that might lead to a slightly more positive view on what we can expect to learn from population-genomic approaches without direct measures of fitness.

**1.** In l. 149–151 you may want to refer to Harris et al. 2016 (doi: 10.1534/genetics.116.186890) and Juriç et al. 2016 (doi: 10.1371/journal.pgen.1006340) for studies that explicitly demonstrate and quantify the extent and strength of purifying selection against Neanderthal-derived introgressed variants. The same references may seem relevant in the context of line 164.

**2.** In the context of conservation (lines 202–210) and/or hybridisation between wild and domesticated organisms (lines 257–258), an example worth mentioning is the introgression from domestic goat of variation at the MHC into the wild relative Alpine ibex studied by Grossen et al. 2014 (10.1371/journal.pgen.1004438). The authors report sweep-like signatures surrounding the focal MHC region in Alpine ibex and conclude that introgression is likely adaptive. However, direct evidence in terms of fitness measures is lacking. 

**3.** I very much appreciate the authors' cautious plea for direct evidence in terms of fitness estimates and/or a demonstrated adaptive function of the questionable gene(s) before adaptive introgression is inferred (lines 268–274). However, introgression may over time have lost its measurable adaptive nature, as the introgressed haplotypes have reached very high frequency or because the environment has changed (again). Such historically adaptive introgression may be very challenging to demonstrate other than by indirect population-genomic methods. In addition, showing direct evidence for adaptive introgression may remain logistically or legally impossible for a number of organisms. In summary, I would therefore vote for a slightly less pessimistic view of indirect population-genomic inference as a means of demonstrating evidence for adaptive introgression. There is still quite some activity on-going in the field towards improving the specificity and resolution of such indirect inference methods, and it would seem too early for a conclusive judgement of this approach.
